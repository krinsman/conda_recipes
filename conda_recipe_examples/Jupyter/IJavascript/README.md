Build script idea is based on [Nicolas Riesco's comments](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript/issues/153#issuecomment-390117545), although all flaws in the implementation of that idea are my own.

See (a probably not up-to-date) version of the final built package [uploaded to Anaconda cloud](https://anaconda.org/krinsman/ijavascript).
