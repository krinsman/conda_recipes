Pieces of example code I like to keep around since they are sometimes useful to me for references. For example, because I found some workaround to do something tricky and wrote down an example of how to do it, or just learned something and created an example expressing my limited mental model for the concept at the time. I think I am supposed to use Gists or Snippets for these instead of a monorepo structure like this, but I prefer the example monorepo structure for now since I can organize things hierarchically and have everything contained in one neat, little tidy repo. In particular, since all of these are just examples and not actual projects, none of them really merit by themselves a standalone repo, but at the same time I also didn't want to delete them entirely. This seemed like a good balance, but of course I might try some other solution in the future.

Anyway, I hope that possibly some part of some of these examples might occasionally be sometimes useful to some of you too at some point in the future.
