# r-screening_conda-recipe
Successfully tested conda build recipe (created with `conda skeleton`) for creating a conda package for the [screening package](https://github.com/wwrechard/screening).

See than package as uploaded on Anaconda cloud [here](https://anaconda.org/krinsman/r-screening).

The package was only built for Mac OS X, it *might* also work on Linux. If you are on Windows, please let me know if this build recipe doesn't work for you.

In general, please contact me with any requests for improvement.
